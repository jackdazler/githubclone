Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a server-rendered React app with a CSP that specifies a nonce for scripts\r\n2. Try to use suspense + streaming\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nAs noted in @sebmarkbage's [comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20970#issuecomment-795404058), nonce support should be added to the scripts that React injects for suspense + streaming. That doesn't appear to be happening. I can't find where in the source code those scripts are generated, but in the built code I notice there's no nonce support of any kind:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar startInlineScript = stringToPrecomputedChunk('<script>');\r\nvar endInlineScript = stringToPrecomputedChunk('</script>');\r\nvar startScriptSrc = stringToPrecomputedChunk('<script src=\"');\r\nvar startModuleSrc = stringToPrecomputedChunk('<script type=\"module\" src=\"');\r\nvar endAsyncScript = stringToPrecomputedChunk('\" async=\"\"></script>');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat appears above a function called `escapeBootstrapScriptContent` which for the life of me I can't find in the react repo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nI should be able to provide a nonce to React (presumably at the `renderToPipeableStream` and `hydrateRoot` calls?) so React can include those in the scripts it creates.\r\n",

    "body": "Elements can be added as children to some parent arbitrarily after being created but after creating a portal there seems to be no obvious way of appending the resulting portal as a child of some other node. This is useful for creating dialogs that need to use multiple contexts available to some node but where there are enough of these dialogs that come from user interaction that it's desirable for them to be invoked functionally (e.g. showDialog).\r\n\r\nThe problem is there seems to be no functioning way for a portal created in this way to properly inherit contexts. I've provided an example showing the creation of some portal and an example method of trying to insert the returned fiber (? - unsure if this is the correct term, React.ReactPortal type) as a child of portalParentRef.\r\n\r\nReact version: 17/18\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a portal with something like\r\n`const portal = ReactDOM.createPortal(\r\n    React.createElement(ExampleComponent),\r\n    document.body);`\r\n2. There does not seem to be an accessible method for appending the resulting React.ReactPortal instance as a child but trying appendChild, or render (which I don't believe can work because we're not trying to mount a real DOM element but instead want to insert this portal as a child in the virtual dom).\r\n3. If we \r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://codesandbox.io/s/silly-brook-25fc4f\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nThe portal can be created which will insert our Dialog (the component which needs access to contexts) at the top level document.body but there seems to be no functioning way for the resulting React.ReactPortal to be added to the virtual DOM thus the created Dialog can't read values from any context.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be some way of adding a created React.ReactPortal to an existing node.\r\n",

    "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've had a regression in one of my app by migrating from React 17 to React 18, and more specifically, by switching from `ReactDOM.render` to `ReactDOM.createRoot`.\r\n\r\nNow, I know that this switch has some breaking changes. So I'm not sure if this is a real bug (meaning maybe it's an acceptable bug due to an accepted breaking change). But in that case, maybe the documentation could be enhance with that example.\r\n\r\nBasically, I have a Popup component that is using some event listenenr on window in order to react to global clicks (and close). By switching from `render` to `createRoot`, it looks like the rendering of the popup is done before the end of the processing of the event opening that same popup (hence, creating an issue of not showing the popup because it closes right after opening).\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nReproduce repository link (with explaination in README): https://github.com/Vinorcola/React-18-event-issue\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nThe popup does not shows because it closes right after opening.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe popup opens on the button click.",

    "body": "\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nI have two independent project : main and features project.  Features project have side effect components: CustomerSearch, UserSearch, AccountSearch, etc and i'm using in main project these.\r\n\r\nBut UserSearch component needs StoreProvider, MessageProvider, ThemeProvider or any provider in main project. And I decided using createPortal.\r\n\r\nUserSearch.tsx in features project:\r\n```\r\nexport const FibaUserSearch = <\r\n  TFieldValues extends FieldValues = Record<string, string | User>,\r\n  TName extends FieldPath<TFieldValues> = FieldPath<TFieldValues>,\r\n>(\r\n  props: UserSearchProps<TFieldValues, TName>,\r\n) => createPortal(<FibaUserSearchInner {...props} />, document.getElementById('container')) \r\n```\r\n\r\nindex.tsx in main project\r\n```\r\n return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <ThemeProvider theme={createTheme(theme, ...muiThemeLang[languageProfile])}>\r\n        <NotificationProvider>\r\n          <LayoutProvider>\r\n            <MessageProvider>\r\n              <Container id=\"container\">\r\n                <Header />\r\n                <FibaBox\r\n                  sx={{\r\n                    p: `${toolbarHeight ?? 0}px 10px 0px 10px`,\r\n                  }}\r\n                >\r\n                 <FibaUserSearch/>\r\n                </FibaBox>\r\n              </Container>\r\n            </MessageProvider>\r\n          </LayoutProvider>\r\n        </NotificationProvider>\r\n      </ThemeProvider>\r\n      <Loading />\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy expectation is that every provider in index.tsx is available for FibaUserSearch. But createPortal doesn't work this case or I didn't understand logic clearly.\r\n\r\nThanks,",

    "body": "This isn't necessarily a bug in React's implementation, but a symptom caused by strict effects. It is pretty common to need to restore focus to another element when a component unmounts. For example, a dialog component would need to restore focus to the element that opened it for proper keyboard accessibility.\r\n\r\nWhen StrictMode is enabled, components are \"mounted\" twice such that their effects and cleanup functions are executed, but the component isn't actually removed from the DOM in this process. If a component moves focus in its effect cleanup function, this has user visible consequences and focus won't be restored back when the component \"mounts\" again. Here is a simple example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction Inner({ restoreRef }) {\r\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n    let el = restoreRef.current;\r\n    return () => {\r\n      // Restore focus on unmount.\r\n      el.focus();\r\n    };\r\n  }, [restoreRef]);\r\n\r\n  return <input autoFocus />;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the browser moves focus to the input when Inner is committed to the DOM. Then, the layout effect cleanup is run, restoring focus to the provided ref. But the component hasn't actually unmounted, so focus should ideally stay on the input.\r\n\r\nOne could try to work around this by not using `autoFocus` and instead using a ref to the input and calling `focus()` on it in the `useLayoutEffect`. That way, when the component \"mounts\" again, the layout effect would run a second time and focus would come back to the input. However, this might have accessibility implications if focus is bouncing around rapidly. It also wouldn't work if you didn't want to auto focus an element on initial mount but still wanted focus restoration on unmount. Ideally there would be a way to avoid strict effects entirely for this use case.\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. https://codesandbox.io/s/async-dust-k8g9uy?file=/src/App.js\r\n2. Press the \"Toggle inner\" button\r\n3. See that focus is not on the auto focused input.\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nStrict effects with side effects in cleanup functions that cannot be undone have no way to only run when the component is actually being removed from the DOM.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nIdeally some way to know if the component is actually being removed from the DOM so this can only happen then. Basically an opt-out of strict effects for this specific use case.",

It always emits a full HTML document even if you only render some body content. With other render methods you only get what you tell React to render for you so if you render a div with some inner content that is all React will output. Using one of the existing render functions requires you to carefully control what is rendered and if you have intermediate layers (like a framework) in place it can force you into a situation where the App author needs to remember to include the document structure (\\<html\\>, \\<head\\>, etc...) or not be allowed to provide it at all. The flexibility of embedding whatever `renderDocument` is given in a full HTML document alleviates this limitation\r\n2. It will attempt to stream preamble content as early as possible, even before the shell has finished rendering. If we discover a stylesheet or script that can be preloaded or preinitialized while still waiting of the shell to complete rendering we want to send that to the client right away. `renderToReadableStream` does not provide you with the stream until the shell has finished.\r\n3. It provides allows you to provide a `fallback` that will render if the Shell for `children` errors. While other methods don't flush anything until the Shell finishes and thus you can spin up a separate render call, or handle the error case with a different status code and response content the `renderDocument` function likely already sent bytes before the Shell has errored so it must coordinate the fallback state more holistically.\r\n\r\n#### Resource Flushing Semantics\r\nSome Resources can flush even before the Shell is finished, including preloads, and scripts. Stylesheets for the first precedence can be flushed as well and we can send preloads for stylesheeets for other precedences. The reason we cannot flush all stylesheets of any precedence early is we need the order to be guaranteed and we don't do any re-ordering on the client so they need to leave the server in the right order unless they are delivered as part of a Suspense Boundary reveal.\r\n\r\n#### Ancillary PR note\r\nA related incidental change accompanies this PR for the other render methods. If we render an `<html>` tag but do not render a `<head>` tag, we will emit an `<head>` tag into the stream just after `<html>` and before any other rendered content (usually a `<body>` but you can have non-spec html). It is possible this tag won't be empty because any Resources that get hoisted to the head will emit there. Currently these tags emit after the html tag and before any rendered content which may work based on permissive Browser HTML parsing rules but is not valid HTML. One might try to argue this is a breaking change but relying on there NOT being a `<head>` is not practically possible given the Browser invents a DOM node for this head anyway",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. In a React SSR app, include a `<noscript` JSX element with text children that contains an HTML entity, such as `&apos;`:\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    export default function App() {\r\n      return <noscript>&apos;</noscript>;\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n2. Render the React app on the server using `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` (no visible warnings appear):\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    const component = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);\r\n    ```\r\n    Of note, this appears to replace the HTML entity in final HTML output with a different entity:\r\n    ```html\r\n    ...<noscript>&#x27;</noscript>...\r\n    ```\r\n3. Attempt to hydrate the React app on the client using `hydrateRoot`:\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    hydrateRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"), <App />);\r\n    ```\r\n4. UI mismatch error occurs at hydration time\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26242455/211048570-2e6f0051-1096-4bcd-91b3-c91f8fdebf46.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React.

Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nUsing an HTML entity in the direct text children of a `<noscript>` tag results in hydration errors on the client. I encountered this while building a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) static site where I wanted to include a `<noscript>`-wrapped warning in a component that only works when JavaScript is enabled (and this message includes an apostrophe character).\r\n\r\nThe following cases encounter the same/a similar error:\r\n- Same example as above (and the one I originally encountered):\r\n\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    <noscript>&apos;</noscript>\r\n    ```\r\n- Using the direct character:\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    <noscript>'</noscript>\r\n    ```\r\n- Using the other HTML entity that React SSR uses, in the original source of the component:\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    <noscript>&#x27;</noscript>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThe following cases do work:\r\n- Wrapping the text containing the HTML entity in a plain `<div>`, inside the `<noscript>`:\r\n\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    <noscript><div>&apos;</div></noscript>\r\n    ```\r\n- Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    <noscript dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: \"&apos;\" }} />\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll of the above cases (except wrapping the HTML entity in a `<div>`) should result in the same behavior, and exhibit no errors when hydrating on the client.\r\n\r\nI believe this may be related to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11423 (although notably the behavior of \"ignore <noscript> content on the client and don't warn about mismatches\" doesn't seem to be case here).\r\n",

    "body": "Within `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector` there is currently a bug that will keep old references to the used store alive if you use an immutable store in combination with selectors that always result in the same result. This can lead to excessive memory usage while this is not needed. I've noticed this behavior in combination with react-redux, but also managed to reproduce it without react-redux to figure out exactly what was going on. (I've reported this at the react-redux repo as well https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1981)\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSince the reproduction is fairly complicated I've created a sandbox with details on how to reproduce including a minimal working sample that also includes the reproduction steps within that exact example.\r\n\r\nBut in summary, it is reproducible using the following steps:\r\n1. You will need an immutable store that you will use with your selector (new copy every store update)\r\n2. You will need a stable custom isEqual function and selector that are not created in-line\r\n3. The store needs some property (e.g. a string) that is easily found within memory snapshots. (It helps to include a timestamp within this property that updates on store change)\r\n4. You will need to print a value from the store within your main component, to show the most recent result of the store.\r\n5. You will need a component that uses a stable selector to select a stale value (something that never changes) from the store\r\n6. Next up you need to update the store and add an additional copy of the previous component (the one created in step 5.)\r\n7. Repeat this a few times\r\n8. Take a memory snapshot and notice there are multiple copies of the store present in memoizedSnapshots of the different components. You can see this by searching on the property you defined in step 3.\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/fervent-ives-0vm9es?file=/src/App.jsx\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n- Whenever the result of getSnapshot() is changed, but the result of the selector() has not, the memoized reference to the old result of getSnapshot() is not updated, resulting in unnecessary copies of the store used alive. Whenever you have a fairly large store that is shared between quite a bunch of selectors, especially with components that are mounted at a later timestamp and use selectors that have stale data, you could end up with an ever increasing amount of store references resulting in high memory usage.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n- Whenever the result of getSnapshot() is changed, but the result of the selector() has not, the memoized reference to the old result of getSnapshot() is updated correctly, preventing unnecessary copies from being kept alive. This should not impact the behavior of `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector` but should/can reduce the memory footprint of applications using this.",
